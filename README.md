# Deutsche-Bank-Financial-Performance

 It is a detailed Power BI analysis and visualization based on financial data from Deutsche Bank (dataset sourced from Kaggle).

 I explored key financial indicators and built an interactive dashboard packed with insights! Here's what I included:
📌 Scorecards for:
💰 Profit
📈 Profit by %
🧾 Net Profit
📊 Net Profit by %
🏷️ Total Cost of Goods Sold

📌 Visuals:
📉 Line & clustered column chart to track Operating Profit and Net Profit over time
🧮 Table summarizing Balance Sheet: Total Assets, Liabilities, and Equity
🔻 Funnel Chart illustrating the Capital Flow between Assets, Liabilities & Equity

📌 Interactivity:
🔘 Slicers for Month and Year
🧹 Clear filters button for quick resets

It was a great exercise in transforming raw financial data into a story with dynamic visuals and actionable insights.
